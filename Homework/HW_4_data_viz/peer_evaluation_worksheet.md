Homework 4 - Peer Evaluation Worksheet

Each peer evaluator should fill our this worksheet.  See instructions for submitting at the bottom.

- Evaluator Name:   **YOUR NAME GOES HERE**
- Evaluator UB Email ID:  **YOUR UB EMAIL ID (the part before `@buffalo.edu`) GOES HERE**


---

## General
- [ ] There is only one `.ipynb` file in the repo.
- [ ] The Jupyter notebook is correctly named, as per the instructions.  
    > Your Jupyter Notebook should be named `ubusername_hw4.ipynb`, where `ubusername` should be replaced with your UB username. For example, my UB username is `cmurray3`; my notebook will be named `cmurray3_hw4.ipynb`.


## Part 1

Check the box next to each TRUE statement. 

1.  Scatter Plot with a Line
    - [ ] The appropriate data plotted as green triangles?
    - [ ] There is a red-dashed line connecting the point with the minimum x-value to the point with the maximum x-value.
    - [ ] The plot has a title of `Widget Measurements`.
    - [ ] The x-axis is labeled `x [inches]`.
    - [ ] The y-asix is labeled `y [inches]`.
    - [ ] A legend showing the green triangles as `observations` and the red-dashed line as `extreme x points` is shown.
    - [ ] There are no typos.
    
2.  Histogram
    - [ ] A histogram is shown with each bar colored orange with a black outline.
    - [ ] The counts for the 5 categories are shown above each bar.
    - [ ] The count values are correct (you need to double-check the input data).
    - [ ] The x-axis is labeled `Grade`.
    - [ ] The y-axis is labeled `Count`.
    - [ ] The title is labeled `Grade Distribution`.
    - [ ] There are no typos.

3. Barplots and Boxplots in the Same Figure
    - [ ] There is a single figure with two subplots.
    - [ ] The overall figure is labeled `Comparison of Optimality Gaps for Heuristics`.
    - The left subplot:
        - [ ] Is a barplot;
        - [ ] Has the correct title for the barplot;
        - [ ] Has orange bars with black outlines;
        - [ ] Has the correct label for each bar on the x-axis; and
        - [ ] Has the correct label for the y-axis.
    - The right subplot:
        - [ ] Is a boxplot;
        - [ ] Has the correct title for the boxplot;
        - [ ] Has an orange line for the median of each category;
        - [ ] Has the same y-axis scale as the left plot; and
        - [ ] Has the correct label for each category on the x-axis.
        
## Part 2

- [ ] A valid link is provided to the plot type documentation.
- [ ] A valid link is provided to the source of the data.
- [ ] You were able to download the source data from the link provided.
- [ ] The code is clearly explained.
- [ ] The plot is not one of the plot styles we have already used in class.

### Submission Instructions
These instructions are written from the point-of-view of the person completing the evaluation.


1.  Ask the person whose code you are evaluating to add you as a 
    - `Settings` -> `Collaborators and teams` -> `Add people` -> email address -> `Write` access
2. Clone the repository that you are going to evaluate (i.e., copy the entire contents of the repository to your computer).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook
    - Complete the above evaluation form as you run the notebook.        
4. Upload your completed evaluation sheet (this `.md` file) to the repository.
5. Submit a "pull request".
